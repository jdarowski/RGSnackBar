## About

This library was created during the development of one of 
[Reality Games'](https://wearerealitygames.com/) games out of need. It has all
the features I needed during development and plenty of room for extensions


## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Requirements

* Swift 2.3


For now RGSnackBar runs on Swift 2.3 as that's what I personally need, but it
will be migrated to Swift 3 and later Swift 4 when needed.

## Installation

RGSnackBar is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "RGSnackBar"
```
